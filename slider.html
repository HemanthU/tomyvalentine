      Before we get to anything important,
      I just wanted to slow things down for a moment. 
      This isn’t meant to be dramatic or overwhelming… it’s just a small journey through a few days that quietly started meaning more to me because of you. 
      Maybe it was in random conversations, or the way we started understanding each other without explaining too much, or just how naturally you became part of my everyday routine. 
      A small journey through our Valentine week…

I didn’t notice it immediately, but slowly your presence started feeling familiar, comfortable, and important. If I ever give you a rose, it won’t be just for the day… it’ll be because you became special to me without even trying. And honestly, I don’t think you even realize how much space you quietly occupy in my thoughts.This rose carries the love I’ve been holding for you.",

text:"I don’t know when liking you turned into caring this much. It didn’t happen in one big moment… it grew in small conversations, random laughs, and the way you stayed close even on ordinary days. Somewhere between all of that, it started feeling natural to imagine you being a constant in my life. No pressure, no drama… just something real, simple, and honest that I don’t want to lose.Today I just want to ask… will you stay with me, always?",

And I won’t lie… some days I open your chat just to feel better, even if I don’t have anything important to say. It’s become a habit now — you, your vibe, and the way you unknowingly make my day softer.Like chocolate, you make my life sweeter every day. I like you better as choclate my favourite",

Because it makes me want to stay around you even more. You feel like that one person I’d want to sit next to, lean on, and not worry about how I look or sound.I wish I could hug you like a teddy and never let go.So wt do u think my cute fluffy teddy BUBU BEAR.

It feels real, and real things deserve patience, understanding, and care. I may not always say the right things, but I’ll always try to stay and make things better instead of walking away.I promise to stand beside you, no matter what comes.",
